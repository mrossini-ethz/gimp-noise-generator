INSTALL
=======

For Linux and Unix users
------------------------
To make a system wide installation simply state

	make
	make install

or for a user installation

	make
	make userinstall

A restart of The GIMP is recommended.

Other platforms
---------------
I'm sorry I have no knowledge on how to install plugins on other platforms. I
hope others will find a way.
