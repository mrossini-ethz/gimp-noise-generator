The noise generator GIMP plugin adds noise to an image. The noise can be of
various types, even combined. There is an option to apply a gamma correction on
the original image before the application of noise as well as an option to
produce luminance noise only.

Supported noise types are:
- Poisson noise
- Gaussian noise
- Uniform noise
- Laplace noise
- Lorentz noise
